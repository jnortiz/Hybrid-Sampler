This is a implementation of the hybrid Gaussian sampler of (Ducas and Prest, 2015) over NTRU lattices. The lattice basis is generated by the Setup algorithm offered by Thomas Prest (see <a href=https://github.com/tprest/Lattice-IBE>Lattice-IBE</a> repository at GitHub). The Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is generated using the Block-GSO method (Lyubashevsky and Prest, 2015), which is suitable only for block isometric basis.
